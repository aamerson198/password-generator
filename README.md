# password-generator

For this application I built a password generator that responds to the users inputs, allowing them to select the number of characters, within a given range, for their password. The user can also choose if their password will include symbols, uppercase and lowercase letters, and/or numbers. The users inputs are taken from a series of confirmations and prompts.
